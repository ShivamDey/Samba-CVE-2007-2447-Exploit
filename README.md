# Samba CVE-2007-2447 Exploit

This is a Python script for exploiting CVE-2007-2447, a vulnerability known as 'Username' map script command execution in the Samba server.

## Description

This exploit is developed to target Samba versions 3.x - 4.x. CVE-2007-2447 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable Samba server by crafting a malicious username and password.

## Usage

1. Set up a listener on your attacker machine, for example, using Netcat: `nc -nvlp 1234`

2. Run the Python script and provide the required information:
   - Your IP (for delivering a reverse shell).
   - Victim's IP.
   - Victim's Port.
   
3. The script will construct a payload for the reverse shell and send it to the target Samba server.

4. If successful, the reverse shell will be executed on the target, connecting back to your machine. You should receive a shell session.
